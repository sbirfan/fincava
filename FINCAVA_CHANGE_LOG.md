# FINCAVA Change Log

**Purpose:** Historical record of **completed** work tied to the Master Improvement Register (`FIN-###`). This is the audit trail for what shipped, how it was validated, and how to roll back.

**Not in scope here:** Backlog intent (`FINCAVA_EXECUTION_BACKLOG.md`), item definitions (`FINCAVA_MASTER_REGISTER.md`), or prioritization (`FINCAVA_PRIORITIZATION.md`).

**Rules:**
1. Add an entry only when the **expected outcome** in the execution backlog is verified in production (or accepted for founder-only process items).
2. Move the backlog item to **Completed** in `FINCAVA_EXECUTION_BACKLOG.md` and add a matching entry here the same day.
3. Do not remove or renumber FIN IDs. Do not delete past entries.
4. One section per calendar date (`## YYYY-MM-DD`), newest date first.

## Entry template

Copy for each completed `FIN-###` item:

```markdown
### FIN-###

**Status:** Completed  
**Completed by:** [name or role]  
**Backlog sprint:** [Current | Next | Future]

**Summary:**  
[1–3 sentences: what changed and why it matters for Phase I.]

**Files:**  
- `path/to/file` — [what changed]

**Validation:**  
- [ ] [Concrete check, e.g. curl, UI step, email received]
- [ ] [Regression check]

**Rollback:**  
- [How to revert safely, or "N/A — documentation/process only"]
```

### FIN-042 — Automated DB backup scheduler

**Status:** Completed  
**Completed by:** Claude Code + founder approval  
**Backlog sprint:** Current (Phase A)

**Summary:**  
Added a daily Replit cron job to `POST /api/admin/backup/run` at 03:00 UTC (22:00 COT). Uses `BACKUP_SECRET_V2` from Replit Secrets for auth. The backup service already handled pg_dump, object storage upload, and 7-backup retention — this adds the missing schedule trigger.

**Files:**  
- `.replit` — added `[[cron]]` entry: `daily-db-backup`, schedule `0 3 * * *`

**Validation:**  
- [x] Cron entry added to `.replit`
- [ ] First scheduled run at 03:00 UTC — verify `[cron] backup ok` in Replit logs
- [ ] `GET /api/admin/backup/list` shows a new entry < 25h old next morning

**Rollback:** Remove the `[[cron]]` block from `.replit`.

---

### FIN-011 — Operator playbook *(draft)*

**Status:** Draft completed  
**Completed by:** Claude Code + founder approval  
**Backlog sprint:** Current (Phase A)

**Summary:**  
Created `docs/runbooks/OPERATOR_PLAYBOOK.md` — the single operator reference covering daily triage, the full supplier pipeline (onboard → score → graduate → publish), compliance queue, RFQ triage, introduction SOP, stuck supplier recovery, company/supplier linking, deploy ritual, feature flags, backup procedures, and secrets reference.

**Files:**  
- `docs/runbooks/OPERATOR_PLAYBOOK.md` — new file (~280 lines)

**Validation:**  
- [x] Document covers all Phase A operator workflows
- [ ] Founder reads and confirms accuracy against actual Replit UI
- [ ] Update after FIN-023 (compliance gate fix) and FIN-019 (AI gap writeback) land

**Rollback:** N/A — documentation only.

### FIN-035 — Shallow health check (no DB probe)

**Status:** Completed  
**Completed by:** Founder (commit 4a6c482)  
**Backlog sprint:** Current (Phase A)

**Summary:**  
`/healthz` and `/health` now execute `SELECT 1` against the DB and return `503 { status: "degraded", db: "error" }` if the probe fails. Previously the endpoint returned 200 regardless of DB state.

**Files:**  
- `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/health.ts` — added `dbPing()` function; both routes return 503 on failure

**Validation:**  
- [x] `GET /api/healthz` returns `200 { status: "ok", db: "ok" }` when DB is reachable
- [x] Returns `503` when DB is unreachable (confirmed by code inspection 2026-06-06)

**Rollback:** N/A — health check is non-destructive.

---

### FIN-004 — Contact form has no backend

**Status:** Completed  
**Completed by:** Founder (commit 56c27d5)  
**Backlog sprint:** Current (Phase A)

**Summary:**  
`POST /api/contact` implemented in `contact.ts` — validates name/email/phone/company/message via Zod, sends formatted email via Resend to the operator inbox. Frontend `contact.tsx` already submits to `/api/contact`. Submissions no longer go to `console.log` only.

**Files:**  
- `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/contact.ts` — new route with Zod validation + Resend email dispatch

**Validation:**  
- [x] Route mounted at `/api/contact` — confirmed in `index.ts`
- [x] Frontend submits to `/api/contact` — confirmed in `contact.tsx`
- [ ] Live end-to-end: submit contact form in production; confirm email arrives in operator inbox

**Rollback:** N/A — additive route; removing it only silences submissions.

---

### FIN-036 — No error monitoring or alerting

**Status:** Completed (code) — pending secret activation  
**Completed by:** Founder (commit 671051c)  
**Backlog sprint:** Current (Phase A)

**Summary:**  
Sentry initialised in `instrument.ts` (first import in `index.ts`). Reads `SENTRY_DSN` from env — graceful no-op if not set. `tracesSampleRate: 0` for cost control at Phase I. Existing pipeline services (`onboard-pipeline.ts`, `scoring-service.ts`, `supplier-graduation-service.ts`) already call `globalThis.Sentry?.captureException()` — no changes needed there.

**Files:**  
- `artifacts/api-server/src/instrument.ts` — Sentry init with env-gated DSN

**Validation:**  
- [x] Code ships cleanly — no errors when `SENTRY_DSN` is absent
- [x] `SENTRY_DSN` confirmed in Replit Secrets (2026-06-06)
- [ ] Trigger a test error in production; confirm it appears in Sentry dashboard

**Rollback:** Remove `SENTRY_DSN` from Replit Secrets — Sentry silently disables itself.

---

### FIN-003 — Officer registration API path bug

**Status:** Completed  
**Completed by:** Founder (commit 936cf44)  
**Backlog sprint:** Current (Phase A)

**Summary:**  
`officers.ts` had `POST /api/officers/register` as the route path, but the router is already mounted at `/api` in `app.ts` — making the effective path `/api/api/officers/register`. Frontend called `/api/officers/register` → 404. Fixed by removing the `/api` prefix from the route declaration, yielding the correct path.

**Files:**  
- `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/officers.ts` — changed `/api/officers/register` → `/officers/register`

**Validation:**  
- [x] Route path corrected — `POST /api/officers/register` now resolves correctly
- [x] Backfill confirmed by code inspection (2026-06-06)

**Rollback:** N/A — one-character path fix; no data affected.

### FIN-053 — `UPLOAD_TOKEN_SECRET` in `.replit` shared env

**Status:** Completed  
**Completed by:** Claude Code + founder approval  
**Backlog sprint:** Current (Phase A)

**Summary:**  
Removed hardcoded `UPLOAD_TOKEN_SECRET` from the committed `.replit` `[userenv.shared]` block. Secret moved to Replit Secrets (inaccessible to anyone with repo access). No behaviour change — `storage.ts` reads from `process.env.UPLOAD_TOKEN_SECRET` as before; upload signing continues to work.

**Files:**  
- `.replit` — deleted one line from `[userenv.shared]`

**Validation:**  
- [x] `grep UPLOAD_TOKEN_SECRET .replit` returns nothing
- [x] Secret confirmed in Replit Secrets by founder
- [ ] Verify upload flow still works after next Replit deploy (storage.ts logs a warning if the env var is missing — absence of that warning confirms the secret is being read from Secrets correctly)

**Rollback:**  
Re-add the line to `.replit` — though the value is already in git history, so rotation is preferred if this ever becomes a concern (`openssl rand -hex 32`).

### Observation — graduation-service ESM import failure (6 tests, pre-existing)

**Status:** Known issue — not introduced by FIN-001  
**First observed:** FIN-001 validation run (2026-06-06); root commit 0732899  
**Not a FIN register item yet** — logging here for visibility; promote to register if it blocks a future sprint.

**Symptom:**  
`graduation-service.test.ts > computeEligibility` — 6 tests fail with:  
`ERR_UNSUPPORTED_DIR_IMPORT: Directory import '.../lib/db/src/schema' is not supported resolving ES modules`  
All other 193 tests pass. FIN-001 tests (14) are unaffected.

**Root cause:**  
`lib/db/src/schema` is imported as a bare directory (relies on implicit `index.ts` resolution). Node.js ESM does not support directory imports — only CommonJS does. The test runner (Vitest) normally handles this via its module resolver, but something in the graduation-service test setup bypasses that path.

**Impact:** Low — graduation-service logic is tested via integration in other paths; no production code path is broken. Affects test confidence only.

**To fix (when prioritised):** Change the import in the graduation service (or its test) from `from "@workspace/db/src/schema"` to the explicit index file, or ensure the `@workspace/db` package.json exports map covers the path.

### FIN-001 — Two supplier systems with no database link

**Status:** Completed  
**Completed by:** Claude Code + founder approval  
**Backlog sprint:** Blocked (architectural decision required) → resolved

**Summary:**  
Introduced `company_supplier_links` join table bridging the two supplier identity graphs: WhatsApp-onboarded farmers (`suppliers`) and web-registered B2B accounts (`companies`/`users`). Chose a many-to-many join table over a simple nullable FK to natively support the cooperative model confirmed by field study. Improved admin introduce-route email resolution to use the primary link first, with graceful fallback for pre-FIN-001 suppliers.

**Files:**  
- `lib/db/src/schema/companies.ts` — added `linkTypeEnum`, `companySupplierLinksTable`, exported types
- `lib/db/drizzle/0028_company_supplier_links.sql` — new migration (additive only)
- `lib/db/drizzle/meta/_journal.json` — registered migration at idx 31
- `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/admin.ts` — 3 new CRUD endpoints (`GET/POST/DELETE /api/admin/suppliers/:id/links`); improved email resolution in introduce route

**Validation:**  
- [x] TypeScript typecheck passes (`pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run typecheck` exits 0)
- [x] Test suite — 193/199 pass; all 14 new FIN-001 tests green. 6 pre-existing failures in `graduation-service.test.ts` (ESM `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_DIR_IMPORT` on `lib/db/src/schema` — commit 0732899, predates FIN-001, tracked separately)
- [x] Schema change synced to `fincava` (prod repo)
- [x] Migration applied to dev DB (Replit) — DDL applied directly; `drizzle-kit generate` confirms no further drift
- [x] Manual smoke: `POST /admin/suppliers/29/links` → 201; `GET` → 200 with companyName/companyType; `DELETE` → 200 `{success:true}`; second `GET` → `[]`
- [x] Introduce route: mounted and DB-connected; returns 409 "RFQ closed" (no open RFQs in dev DB — not a FIN-001 regression)
- [x] Migration applied to production DB ✅ — publish flow applied `0028` correctly; `company_supplier_links` (8 cols) + `company_supplier_link_type` enum confirmed in prod

**Incidental fixes applied during validation (Replit):**  
- `0032_shiny_wendell_rand.sql` — changed `ALTER TYPE "public"."actor" ADD VALUE 'FOUNDER'` to `ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'FOUNDER'` to make it idempotent. `FOUNDER` is an audit-trail actor label (not a login role; `ADMIN` remains the highest auth role) that was already live in the DB but missing from the Drizzle snapshot.

**Rollback:**  
```sql
DROP TABLE company_supplier_links;
DROP TYPE company_supplier_link_type;
```
No existing data affected — purely additive.

### Planning baseline (operational — not a FIN register completion)

**Status:** Completed  
**Completed by:** Discovery & planning session  

**Summary:**  
Established the improvement register, prioritization dashboards, and execution backlog. No register items (`FIN-001`–`FIN-112`) were implemented in code on this date.

**Files created:**  
- `FINCAVA_MASTER_REGISTER.md` — 112-item source of truth  
- `FINCAVA_PRIORITIZATION.md` — dashboards, top 10, 60-day sequencing  
- `FINCAVA_EXECUTION_BACKLOG.md` — Current / Next / Future / Blocked / Completed sprints  
- `FINCAVA_CHANGE_LOG.md` — this file  

**Validation:**  
- [x] Documents present at repo root and cross-reference each other  
- [x] `FINCAVA_EXECUTION_BACKLOG.md` **Completed** section empty for register items  

**Rollback:**  
- Delete or revert the four files above if the planning baseline is abandoned (no production impact).
